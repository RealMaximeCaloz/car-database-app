# Car Database Web App

# Project Overview
[Click here to view this project's code repository](https://github.com/RealMaximeCaloz/car-database-app)

This project is a database web app which visually shows off the various specs of different cars, with the help of dynamically-resizing progress bars.
The wider the bar, the better that particular spec of the car is.

Down below, you can see screenshots of this car database web app in full glory, thanks to its visual appeal.

You can use the left and right triangular buttons to navigate between the specs of various cars.

If you would like even more control, you may click the title banner in the middle to make a drop down menu appear. From this menu, you can choose to display whichever car you wish.
